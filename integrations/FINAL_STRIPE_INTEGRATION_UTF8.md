# FINAL Stripe Integration (Frontend)

## Scope
This document describes how the frontend should integrate with the current backend Stripe flow.

- Current backend payment flow: **PaymentIntent-based custom flow**
- Recommended for new features: **Checkout Sessions / Payment Element-first**

## Required Backend Endpoints

### 1) Create Payment Intent
- **Method**: `POST`
- **URL**: `/payments/create-intent`
- **Auth**: required (cookie-based auth)
- **Body**:
```json
{
  "amount": 50.0,
  "currency": "usd",
  "description": "Service Order: ...",
  "userId": 123
}
```
- **Success (201)**:
```json
{
  "clientSecret": "pi_..._secret_...",
  "paymentId": "uuid",
  "stripePaymentIntentId": "pi_..."
}
```

### 2) Webhook (Backend-only)
- **Method**: `POST`
- **URL**: `/api/stripe/webhook`
- Called by Stripe only. Frontend must **not** call this endpoint.

### 3) User Payment Status (for webhook-driven updates)
- **Method**: `GET`
- **URL**: `/payments/:id`
- Use this endpoint from checkout polling to track final status for the authenticated owner.

### 4) Admin status endpoint (dashboard only)
- **Method**: `GET`
- **URL**: `/admin/payments/:id`

## Frontend Payment Flow (Current)

1. Call `POST /payments/create-intent`.
2. Use returned `clientSecret` with Stripe.js confirmation on frontend.
3. Show pending state immediately after confirmation attempt.
4. Wait for backend webhook processing to finalize status.
5. Refresh payment status via polling or realtime channel using `GET /payments/:id`.
6. Only clear cart and show final success after backend status is `succeeded`.

## Payment Status Values
Frontend should support these statuses:
- `pending`
- `succeeded`
- `failed`
- `partially_refunded`
- `refunded`

## UX Rules
- `pending`: show "Payment processing".
- `succeeded`: show success confirmation and clear cart.
- `failed`: show retry action.
- `partially_refunded`: show refunded amount and remaining settled amount.
- `refunded`: show fully refunded state.

## Important Notes
- Webhook is source of truth for final payment state.
- Do not mark payment final based only on client confirmation result.
- Do not expose Stripe secret keys in frontend.
- Use publishable key only on frontend.

## Error Handling
- `400`: validation/user input issue.
- `401`: auth missing/expired.
- `502`: Stripe/backend gateway issue; show retry message.

## Recommended Next Iteration
For new checkout experiences, prefer migrating frontend flow to Checkout Sessions / Payment Element-backed Checkout Sessions to align with Stripe best-practice direction.
